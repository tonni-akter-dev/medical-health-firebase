        <p>Pair large text with an image to give focus to your chosen product, collection, or blog post. Add details on availability, style, or even provide a review. Even if you can't afford to travel the world, you can take your children to the museum, zoo or local park. And don't be afraid to take them to grown-up spots. Eating out in a restaurant teaches children how to be quiet and polite and gives them the pleasure of knowing you trust them to behave.</p>
